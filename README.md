UniversalDot Improvement Proposals (UIPs)

We expect improvements on the UniversalDot protocol to come from the community as well.

People wishing to submit UIPs, first should propose their idea or document to info@universaldot.foundation mailing list.  After internal discussion and  evaluation, please open a PR in this repository . After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.
